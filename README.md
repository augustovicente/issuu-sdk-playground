# Issuu SDK Playground

A playground for the Issuu API V2 SDK so customers can test and see how the public Issuu SDK works.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have an Issuu account and an API key. If you don't have an account, you can create one [here](https://www.issuu.com/). Once you have an account, you can create an API key [here](https://issuu.com/home/integrations).
Then you can use the API key to authenticate your requests placing them on the token input.

## Installation

```bash
yarn # or npm i
```

## Usage

```bash
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```
